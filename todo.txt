last minute thoughts about the combat system:

so attack energy cost, right?
fork/melee attacks cost less the closer the target is to the server
spoon/ranged attacks cost less the further away the target is to the server
BUT cost racks up if you target a different section
characters proficient in the attack they use get a damage boost & might activate additional effects
